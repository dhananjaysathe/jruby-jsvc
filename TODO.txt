 - tighten up package dependencies - installing on to a plain 5.0.8 is broken, probably also on to debian 6.0
 - allow jruby-jsvc-initd to work with jruby as well as ruby1.8
 - use 'profiles' with initd generator to supply sensible defaults
 - help for the initd generator and better error messages when it fails
 - build debian packages for the example app to show how it's done
 - win32/procrun support - I believe this is done, but I can't test it (not a windows user)
